Description: We investigate the plausibility of extending a rotation forest, originally proposed for classification purpose, to survival analysis. Currently, PCA(Principal components analysis) , SPLS(Sparse partial least squares) rotation are supported. For a detailed information, see the papers by Zhou L, Xu Q, Wang H. (2015) Rotation survival forest for right censored data. <https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1009> and Zhou L, Xu Q, Wang H. (2016), Random rotation survival forest for high dimensional censored data. <https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-3113-5>.
